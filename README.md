![AgConnect logo](images/agconnect.png)

> AgConnect is an AI-powered calling platform that transforms simple text prompts into dynamic, conversational voice agents. Users can instantly design and deploy intelligent, human-like agents for any task, from automated customer support to personalized outbound calls, just by describing how they should speak and behave.

## Overview

**AgConnect** is a backend foundation for a Software-as-a-Service application that allows users to build and interact with personalized AI agents. For example, you can configure a voice agent to act as a historical figure, business coach, or technical support specialist.

After each voice call, the service records the interaction and enables follow-up chat conversations so users can analyze the call, ask questions, and obtain summaries. The project ships with a production-grade, scalable architecture that includes authentication and data management and is ready for payment gateway integration.

This repository provides the backend infrastructure, ready to be deployed and integrated with a frontend application.

## Built With

- [FastAPI][fastapi-url]
- [Python][python-url]
- [Docker][docker-url]
- [Supabase][supabase-url]
- [Postgres][postgres-url]

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to run AgConnect locally.

### Prerequisites

This project runs within Docker containers, so you only need **Docker** and **Docker Compose**.

- **Docker Desktop** – Install the appropriate version for your operating system via the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

### Installation

1. **Get API Keys** – Gather credentials for the services listed below:
   - **Supabase:** Create a project at [Supabase.io](https://supabase.io) to obtain a Project URL and an `anon` key.
   - **Generative AI:** Request API keys from [Google AI Studio (Gemini)](https://aistudio.google.com/) and/or [Groq](https://groq.com/).
2. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_github_username/AgConnect.git
   cd AgConnect
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables** – Create a `.env` file from the example template.

   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Populate the `.env` file with the values collected in step 1, a secure `SECRET_KEY`, and database credentials.

4. **Build and Run the Application** – Start the services with Docker Compose.

   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   The FastAPI application will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Usage

Once the stack is running, interact with the API through its interactive documentation.

1. Open a browser and visit `http://localhost:8000/docs`.
2. Explore the Swagger UI to review and test available endpoints.
3. Typical workflow:
   - Register a new user.
   - Log in to obtain a JWT access token.
   - Use the token to call protected endpoints that create and manage AI agents.

Refer to the API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs` for additional examples.

## Roadmap

- [x] Core API and Docker environment setup
- [ ] User authentication endpoints (`/register`, `/login`)
- [ ] Agent creation and configuration endpoints
- [ ] Database CRUD operations for users and agents
- [ ] Real-time voice call handling (WebSocket or WebRTC)
- [ ] Post-call chat functionality
- [ ] Stripe payment gateway integration
- [ ] Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- [ ] Full-stack deployment
  - [ ] Frontend interface (for example, React or Vue)
